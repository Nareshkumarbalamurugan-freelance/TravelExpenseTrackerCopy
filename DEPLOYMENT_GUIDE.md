        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Admin settings - authenticated users can read

      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // Add admin check here later
    }
    
    // Position rates - authenticated users can read

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails:**
- Check Node version is 18+

- Verify Mapbox token is set correctly
- Check browser permissions for location
- Ensure HTTPS (Render provides this automatically)

**Admin Panel Not Accessible:**
- Verify admin credentials in environment variables
- Check Firebase Auth configuration
- Clear browser cache and cookies

**Data Not Saving:**
- Check Firebase project ID in environment variables
- Verify Firestore security rules
- Check browser console for errors

### Getting Help
1. Check Render build logs for specific errors
2. Use browser developer tools to debug
3. Verify Firebase and Mapbox configurations
4. Test locally first with `npm run dev`
