```

**AFTER Fix:**
```
🔍 UnifiedEmployeeService: Searching by employee ID in employees collection...
🔍 UnifiedEmployeeService: Searching by email in employees collection...
🔍 UnifiedEmployeeService: Searching by employee ID in users collection...
🔍 UnifiedEmployeeService: Searching by email in users collection...
