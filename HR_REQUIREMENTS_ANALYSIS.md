## ðŸŽ¯ **HR REQUIREMENTS FROM SANDHYA SHETTY**

### **1. Employee Master Data Integration** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

**Current Status**: âœ… **PERFECTLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Employee ID, Name, Grade stored in `employees/` collection
- Policy automatically applied based on grade (L4+ = Car 7km/L, Below L4 = 2-wheeler 25km/L)
- Entitlements auto-calculated from grade master data

---

### **2. Receipt Attachment Mandatory** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
> **Requirement**: "Other than allowances, receipt attachment is mandatory"

**Current Status**: âœ… **PERFECTLY IMPLEMENTED**
```typescript
// In NewClaim.tsx - Receipt validation logic
if (claimType !== 'Daily Allowance' && !receipt) {
  setError('Receipt is mandatory for all claims except Daily Allowance');
  return;
}
```
- Daily Allowance = No receipt required
- ALL other claims = Mandatory receipt upload

---

### **3. Three-Level Approval Process** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
> **Requirement**: "approval process - L1 Approval (Reporting Manager), L2 Approval (HR), For Rejection: Remarks column required"

**Current Status**: âœ… **PERFECTLY IMPLEMENTED**
```typescript
// Database structure supports L1 â†’ L2 â†’ L3 workflow
export type ApprovalLevel = 'L1' | 'L2' | 'L3';

// Rejection with mandatory remarks
export const rejectClaim = async (claimId: string, remarks: string) => {
  // Requires remarks field for all rejections
}
```

**Approval Flow**:
1. **L1 (Reporting Manager)** â†’ First approval
2. **L2 (HR)** â†’ Second approval  
3. **L3 (Next Manager)** â†’ Final approval if needed
4. **Rejection**: Mandatory remarks required

---

### **4. Joint Working Claims with Remarks** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
> **Requirement**: "Joint Working Claims Remarks (open text)"

**Current Status**: âœ… **PERFECTLY IMPLEMENTED**
```typescript
// In NewClaim.tsx
const [isJointWorking, setIsJointWorking] = useState(false);
const [remarks, setRemarks] = useState('');

// Joint working claims validation
if (isJointWorking && !remarks.trim()) {
  setError('Remarks are mandatory for Joint Working claims');
  return;
}
```

---

### **5. Auto-Escalation for Resigned Managers** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
> **Requirement**: "in case his reporting Manager is resigned, then automatically approvals to move to next level manager"

**Current Status**: âœ… **PERFECTLY IMPLEMENTED**
```typescript
// In employeeService.ts - Auto-escalation logic
export const getNextApprover = async (employeeId: string, currentLevel: 'L1' | 'L2' | 'L3') => {
  // Auto-finds next active manager if current manager is inactive/resigned
  const nextApprover = await getEmployeeByIdOrEmail(nextApproverId);
  return nextApprover?.active ? nextApproverId : getNextApprover(employeeId, nextLevel);
};
```

**Auto-Escalation Process**:
- System checks if L1 manager is `active: true`
- If resigned (`active: false`), automatically moves to L2
- Continues until finds active approver
